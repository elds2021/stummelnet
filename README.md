# StummelNet: Cigarette Butt Detection Model

## Overview

StummelNet is a Machine Learning model specialized in detecting cigarette butts in images. Developed using TensorFlow and Keras, this model employs Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning techniques to provide a robust and balanced performance. The model has been meticulously optimized and evaluated using a variety of metrics and has shown promising results in identifying cigarette butts, contributing to waste management and environmental awareness initiatives.

## Features

- **Efficient and Lightweight**: Developed with a focus on performance and efficiency, making it suitable for mobile applications.
- **Balanced Performance**: Exhibits stable and balanced results across various evaluation metrics.
- **Extensively Tested**: Trained with over 70 model variants from four different architectures over a span of 48 hours.
